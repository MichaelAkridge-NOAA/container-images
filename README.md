# container-images

To add images

* Create new dir in `images` directory for your image . Add Dockerfile there.
* Create new build-docker.yml in `.github/workflows` folder
* Push some changes and should rebuild

See `images/jupyter-base-notebook` for a simple example using a `environment.yml` file
