# NMFS Open Science Docker Stack

### Beta release June 1, 2024.

These are a collection of container images that provide standardized environments for Python and R with Jupyter Lab, RStudio and VS Code IDEs. The images are built off the [Rocker](https://rocker-project.org/images/devcontainer/images.html), [Pangeo](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-docker-images) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) base images. This repo holds the stable Docker stack for specific pipelines used in Fisheries. The images are designed to work out-of-box and identically in Jupyter Hubs, Codespaces, Binder, etc.Read the Design section below on what the NMFS Open Sci Docker Stack does.  For use instructions, see [INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://nmfs-opensci/container-images/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Stable set of images

There are many other images in the `images` folder that are experimental in nature.  *If you are looking for standard Python or R Docker images, go to the base Docker stacks linked above.*

```{r echo=FALSE}
source("parse_dockerfile.R")
table_line <- function(i){
#    fil <- paste0("images/",i,"/DESCRIPTION")
    fil <- paste0("images/",i,"/Dockerfile")
  desc <- ""
  if(file.exists(fil)){
#    desc <- readLines(fil, warn=FALSE)
    desc <- parse_dockerfile(fil)
  }
  branch <- system(paste0("git show-ref refs/heads/", i, " ignore.stdout = TRUE"))
  binder_button <- ""
  if(branch == 0) binder_button <- paste0("[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nmfs-opensci/container-images/", i, ")")
  cat("| [", i, "](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/container-images/pkgs/container/container-images%2F", i, ") <br/> ![](https://ghcr-badge.egpl.dev/nmfs-opensci/container-images%2F", i,"/size?color=%2344cc11&tag=latest&label=image+size&trim=) <br/> ![](https://ghcr-badge.egpl.dev/nmfs-opensci%2Fcontainer-images/", i, "/latest_tag?color=%2344cc11&ignore=latest&label=version&trim=) | ", desc, " | [![Button GCS]](https://codespaces.new/nmfs-opensci/container-images?devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2F", i, "%2Fdevcontainer.json) <br/> ", binder_button, " |  [Dockerfile](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/container-images/tree/main/images/", i, "/Dockerfile) <br> [directory](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/container-images/tree/main/images/", i, ") |\n", sep="")
}
```

| Image      | Description  | Open  | info  |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------------|-----------|
|   **Base**      |    Use as the base image when possible   |      |      |
```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
imgs <- c("py-geospatial", "py-rocket-base", "py-rocket-geospatial")
for(i in imgs) table_line(i)
```
|         |       |      |     |
|   **Specialized**      |   Images for specific analyses    |      |     |
```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
imgs <- c("arcgis", "coastwatch", "echopype", "vast", "aomlomics-jh")
for(i in imgs) table_line(i)
```

## Design principles

The images are designed to be deployable "out of the box" from JupyterHubs, Codespaces, GitPod, Colab, Binder, and on your computer via Docker or Podman with no modification. See instructions below. Each will spin up Jupyter Lab with Jupyter Lab (and Notebook), RStudio and VS Code with the specific development environment.

-   Python environment follows Pangeo images with micromamba installed as the solver and base and notebook environments. The Jupyter modules are installed in notebook conda environment and images will launch with the notebook environment activated, again following Pangeo design structure. Images that use Pangeo as base will have user jovyan and user home directory home/jovyan.
-   Images with R ONLY follow Rocker's environment design with the exception that the user home directory is home/jovyan so it plays nice with JupyterHub deployments. The user is rstudio however.
-   When an image contains both R and Python, the base image is rocker and micromamba is installed along with the Pangeo environment structure. RStudio will use the Python environment in the notebook conda environment when Python is used from within RStudio.
-   These images are not terribly light-weight (they are large). Use the original Jupyter, Pangeo or Rocker images if you are looking for lightweight data science images.

## Why use a container?

The main reason is that geospatial, bioinformatics, and TMB/INLA environments can be hard to get working right. Using a Docker image means you use a stable environment. Watch this video from Yuvi Panda (Jupyter Project) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgLPpULvBbQ) and read about the Rocker Project in the R Project Journal [article](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-065/RJ-2017-065.pdf) by Carl Boettiger and Dirk Eddelbuettel.

### Acknowledgements

The core stack is credited to the work of Luis Lopez (NASA) who developed the NASA Openscapes Python image used in countless workshops on cloud-computing with NASA Earth Data. Subsequently the NASA Openscapes mentor cloud-infrastructure Slack group and weekly co-work sessions plugged away at the problem of helping users 'fledge' off the Openscapes JupyterHub, which involved creating images that were more versitile. Carl Boettiger (UC Berkeley & Rocker Project) and Eli Holmes (NOAA Fisheries) took on different aspects of this. The GitHub Action tooling is curtesy of Carl. Yuvi Panda (Jupyter, 2i2c) was also very helpful in desiging the 'scaffolding' in the images that helps them be robust and versitile. The Codespaces and devcontainer code is based on Michael Akridge's [Open Science Codespaces](https://github.com/MichaelAkridge-NOAA/Open-Science-Codespaces) work. Individual images have different core developers: Tim Haverland (arcgis), Sunny Hospital (coastwatch), Luke Thompson (aomlomics).

The Dockerfile code is released under Apache 2.0, a very permissive open source license which does not require that you make you own modifications open. See the README.md files for the licenses for specific code used in the Docker files.
