Hi  USERNAME, weâ€™re tagging you to work on this so we can start tackling and closing issues as we develop the Cookbook.

Could you please start developing an outline and text for [LINK](URL). It would be great if you can start pushing updates to GitHub as you develop it so we can all see progress and get/give feedback. And if there is someone else who you think would be a better fit for this issue or from whom you'd like feedback, please respond here and tag them!

You can refer to our [outline google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12uEPP_w4M4SMrLkcVzUwX7htWtTzlS5a3ahJnK7fSAs/edit) for some more planning context, as well as notes for our [contributing workflow](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/contributing/workflow.html) for how to do work with GitHub branches and Quarto. Totally happy to talk through more and screenshare at a co-working session (or Slack us to set another time)!
