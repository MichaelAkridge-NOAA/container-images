This uses the [NOAA AOML Tourmaline Docker image](https://github.com/aomlomics/tourmaline) as a base and adds tooling so that it can be launched in a JupyterHub.  Per the AOML repo: "Tourmaline is an amplicon sequence processing workflow for Illumina sequence data that uses QIIME 2 and the software packages it wraps. Tourmaline manages commands, inputs, and outputs using the Snakemake workflow management system." See the base repo for information.
